# Getting There is Half the Fun: Comparing Multimodal Transport Systems in AMS and BLR! 

The comparison of navigation patterns among different cities is an intriguing topic, particularly in exploring how the multimodal transport system of one city may inform the development of another. By using data visualizations such as space-time cubes and interactive maps, this study aims to understand the transport infrastructure in two dissimilar cities, compare time and space between them and, identify the gaps5 in the time and the routes, and their impact on urban structure. 

 The goal of this study is to visualize the differences in the transport systems6 based on two major criteria: the time it takes to cover the space it spreads in and understand how the cities are built for multimodal transport systems to be effectively incorporated. 

This research also tries to highlight the importance of maps as a tool for understanding urban infrastructure and identifying areas for improvement in transport systems, and to devise simple strategies that can help improve transportation in both cities, which can contribute to better urban development.
